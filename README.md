NOTES/QUESTIONS

important: npm init -y --- this will set up npm (and include package.json)
run: node <filename>

where is my database file location?

use jquery? multi js files require and reference on either end must import argument into function and module.export function

//***WARNING*** git bash is not currently happy with this const
//const db = require("./db/connection");
causes bash to auto exit when running node index (cursor also disappears)

check mysql2 documentation for async functions

mysql standalone - mysql2 connection to vscode
